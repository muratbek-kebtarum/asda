# Here is my 3-datasets

## 1. Title: World Bank – Germany Population Data
##### Description:  
This dataset provides annual population data for Germany from 1960 to 2024. It is maintained by the World Bank and includes the total number of residents per year. The data is useful for understanding demographic trends, population growth, and social development over time.  

##### Why:  
I chose this dataset because it is simple, clear, and helps to practice data visualization and trend analysis. It’s great for beginners to learn how to work.

## 2. Title: Lifestyle and Health Data
##### Description:  
A collection of lifestyle records including daily routines, sleep hours, diet habits, and physical activity. The dataset reflects how personal habits influence health and overall well-being.  

##### Why:  
I picked this dataset because it connects data science with real human behavior — it’s interesting to analyze how small lifestyle choices can impact health. This is a great opportunity to practice exploratory data analysis and correlation studies.

## 3. Title: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset
##### Description:  
This dataset contains measurements of cell nuclei from breast mass images. It helps predict whether a tumor is likely to be benign or malignant based on several computed features such as radius, texture, and smoothness.  

##### Why:  
I chose this dataset because it’s beginner-friendly but still related to biological cells. It’s an excellent way to learn data preprocessing, visualization, and basic machine learning for medical classification.

P.S. I like biology.
